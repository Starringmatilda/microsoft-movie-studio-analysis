    "The problem at hand is to determine the viability of Microsoft establishing a movie studio. The objective is to analyze various data points such as movie ratings, budgets, genres, and gross revenues to gain insights into the factors that contribute to the success and profitability of movies. By understanding the types of movies that have the potential to generate substantial gross revenues and a high return on investment (ROI), Microsoft can make informed decisions about entering the competitive film market. The goal is to identify the risks, challenges, and opportunities associated with establishing a movie studio and provide actionable recommendations on how Microsoft can effectively penetrate the film market, allocate resources wisely, and potentially form strategic partnerships. Ultimately, the aim is to position Microsoft for success in the dynamic and rewarding film industry.\n",

    "The questions to be answered by this analysis include:\n",
    "- What are the most common genres according to the movies?\n",
    "-  What are the top 5 highest rated movie genres?\n",
    "- Which genres tend to have the highest Return on Investment (ROI), and which genres tend to have the lowest Return on Investment (ROI)?\n",
    "- What is the distribution of net profit across different movie genres, and are there any genres that consistently tend to generate higher net profits than others?\n",
    "-  Is there a correlation between the production budget and the net profit?\n",
    "- Which movie studios have generated the highest net profit?"
